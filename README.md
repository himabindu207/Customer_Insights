# 🧠 BehaviorIQ – Customer Behavior Storytelling Dashboard

> **From raw customer data to clear, data-driven stories.**

BehaviorIQ is an end-to-end data analytics project that transforms a raw customer dataset into meaningful insights using **Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Power BI**. The goal of this project is not just analysis, but **storytelling with data** — answering business questions in a way that is simple, visual, and easy for anyone to understand.

## 📖 Project Story

Every dataset has a story hidden inside it.

In this project, I started with a raw customer dataset filled with inconsistencies, missing values, and duplicate records — just like real-world data. Through careful cleaning, transformation, and analysis, the data was shaped into a reliable source of truth and finally visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The dashboard allows users to **ask questions, explore patterns, and understand customer behavior** without needing any technical background.

---

## 🔍 What This Project Answers

The dashboard and analysis are designed to answer questions such as:

* Who are our customers across different **age groups and genders**?
* Which **product categories** drive the most engagement and revenue?
* How does purchasing behavior vary across customer segments?
* What patterns emerge when customer data is grouped meaningfully?
* How can cleaned data improve the quality of business decisions?

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python)

All data preprocessing was performed using **Python in Jupyter Notebook**, following real-world data cleaning practices:

* Downloaded raw customer dataset
* Removed **duplicate records** to ensure accuracy
* Identified and handled **null / missing values**
* Cleaned inconsistent and irrelevant columns
* Grouped customers into **age brackets** for better analysis
* Standardized **categories** to remove inconsistencies
* Prepared a final, clean dataset ready for analysis

This step ensured the data was reliable, structured, and suitable for further processing.

## 🗄️ Database Management & SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

After cleaning, the processed dataset was stored in a **PostgreSQL database** for structured data management.

Using **SQL**, analytical queries were written to:

* Segment customers based on behavior
* Analyze purchase patterns across categories
* Aggregate metrics such as counts and totals
* Answer business-focused questions efficiently

This step demonstrates how databases are used in real analytics workflows to manage and query large datasets.

## 📊 Data Visualization & Storytelling (Power BI)

The cleaned and analyzed data was then connected to **Power BI**, where an interactive dashboard was created.

### Dashboard features:

* Clean, aesthetic, and user-friendly layout
* Visual breakdowns by **age group, gender, and category**
* Interactive slicers for dynamic exploration
* KPI-style summary views for quick insights
* A storytelling approach that guides the user through the data

The focus was on making insights **intuitive and engaging**, so that even non-technical users can understand the story behind the data.
